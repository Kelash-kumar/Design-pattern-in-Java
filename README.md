# Design-pattern and spring boot-in-Java
This design pattern implementation is done using java language.
Today we will see the implementation of **Singleton Design pattern** and **Factory design patterns :**
# What is the Design Patterns?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that software developers encounter when designing software applications. In Java, design patterns are implemented as best practices that help developers write code that is more maintainable, flexible, and scalable.

Some commonly used design patterns in Java include:

<h4>Singleton pattern</h4> This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

<h4>Factory pattern</h4> This pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

<h4>Observer pattern</h4> This pattern allows objects to be notified when the state of another object changes.

<h4>Decorator pattern</h4> This pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

<h4>Adapter pattern</h4> This pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a common interface that both can use.

Template method pattern: This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
